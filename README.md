# ISOMORPHIC REACT APP SAMPLE

## Features
* App is built with React, Redux, and React-Router v4
* Prefetch data on the server based on routes
* Compile client and server with Webpack 3
* Import SCSS file from the react module
* Transpile with Babel stage 0 for the latest js features
* Testing with Jest
* Folder structure by module and not by type

## Installation
* Make sure you have installed Yarn and NodeJS 8 or up.
* To install node modules, run:
  ```
  yarn
  ```

## Folder Structure
* **config** - holds build configurations like webpack, and eslint
* **src** - this is the source folder, and it's composed of:
    * **modules** - a group a folders, one per app module, each containing
      all the files needed for this module.
    * **public** - these files are static files, like images for example,
      that will be copied to the `dist/client/public` folder during build.
    * **tests** - test files, divided by module.
* **dist** - This folder is generated by webpack and contains the
             dev/prod build of the app.

## How to use?
* For development environment, run
  ```
  yarn dev
  ```
  This will fire up webpack, and nodemon that will recompile and restart
  the server on every change.
* For testing, run
  ```
  yarn test
  ```
  This will fire up Jest and run all files that match `*.test.js`
* For production build, run:
  ```
  yarn build
  ```
  This will replace the content of `dist` folder with ready-to-deploy
  production build.
